Design
------

3 (beta: 0.5 / 0.99 / 1.5) x 3 (exp final tone: low / med / high) x 3 (tone dur: 150 / 300 / 600 ms)

- there will be 3 (beta) x 3 (exp final tone) = 9 unique pitch sequences used in the experiment
- so for instance, for the (beta=0.5, exp final tone=low) pitch sequence, 3 tone sequences will be created using tone duration = 150, 300, 600 ms

- each unique tone sequence (3x3x3=27) will be presented 12 times throughout the experiment
- for the 12 repetitions, one of 6 possible final tone pitches will be presented, twice each (same as in original experiment)
 

for MEG, a 10 minute resting state recording will be conducted prior to the main experiment.


Block structure
---------------

3 x 3 x 3 x 12 = 324 trials in total


324 trials / 12 blocks = 27 trials / block

counterbalancing:
one level of beta (3) x exp final tone (3) x stim dur (3) for each block = 27 trials

i.e. present each unique stim once. randomize order within blocks.


Behavioral responses
--------------------

on each trial, subject rates
- final tone probability (scale of 1-5)
- trend strength (scale of 1-3)

for MEG experiments, both responses will be entered by a single, left-handed button box.
for behavioral experiments, responses will be entered by separate sets of keys on the keyboard.
